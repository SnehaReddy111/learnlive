        Technical Architecture
The technical architecture defines the technologies that are used to implement and support a BI solution that fulfills the information and data architecture requirements. These technologies cover the entire BI life cycle of design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, performance tuning, and user support.

Note: The following section introduces the technologies used in BI, data integration and data warehousing. The figures presented in this section are high-level or simplified versions of what will be examined in more detail in the follow-on architecture chapters or sections on data, data integration, and BI design.

PRODUCTS VERSUS TECHNOLOGIES
Note that it is a common mistake to confuse the technical architecture with the products themselves. This typically happens because people associate products with specific technologies. It is important to remember that products may incorporate many technologies, especially with vendors extending their product lines and supporting a wide range of technologies. Resist the urge to evaluate products immediately. Determine your information and data needs, and then select the technologies that will support them.
